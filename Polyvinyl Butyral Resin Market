Global Polyvinyl Butyral Resin Market Insights
Polyvinyl Butyral Resin Market size was valued at USD 3.50 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.00 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2024 to 2030.

Polyvinyl Butyral Resin Market Overview
The global polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resin market was valued at approximately USD 3.53 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.13 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.35% during the forecast period. PVB resins are widely used in applications requiring strong binding, optical clarity, adhesion to surfaces, toughness, and flexibility. They are primarily manufactured through a reaction between polyvinyl alcohol and butyraldehyde. Over the years, PVB resins have been extensively used in automotive applications as an interlayer in windshields. They are now increasingly used in luxury cars to make side and roof glass with the purpose to increase safety and reduce noise and light transfer. Furthermore, they are also used in architectural applications for window covering with the purpose to promote energy saving and reducing noise. PVB resin also finds applications in solar panel encapsulants but it’s relatively a small market in the present scenario.
